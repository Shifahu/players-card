Development Process

I started off by creating the component template in the HTML file, so that I could use DOM manipulation to render the necessary values required.

I imported the JSON files into my app.js file by installing a http server so that I could do a fetch request to the JSON file.

explain the process of what I have done with each function

Design-wise, I stuck to a simple and clean design, attempting to copy the example given.

 As a future improvement, I think I could add some simple transition animations to when each player was selected from the dropdown.

 I would have styled the error modal so that it was more fitting to the design spec

 I would also write some snapshot tests & explain why I would write those snapshot tests and what for -- for the functions that render things in the actual html

 how would I use gulp?
